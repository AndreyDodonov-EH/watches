# Physical materials: how a liquid's properties become a look

Status: contract and formula table (plan block A, 2026-09-25). Implementation follows in
`sim/src/material/` (blocks B–D). The 2026-09-18 standalone optical renderer (`sim/physical.html`,
`firmware/src/physical/`) is retired 2026-09-25; its cylinder trace, Fresnel and Beer–Lambert code
(now `sim/src/material/optics/`) is the colour model here.

## Architecture

A physical preset is a **material** (`spec/material-schema.json`: 30 numeric properties with units,
bounds and defaults — optics, fluid, wetting, gas, vessel, lighting) plus a **design** object (the
allowlisted legacy `Params` keys for layout, backing, marks and watch behaviour, listed in the schema's
`design.allow`). `derive(material, design) → Params` (`sim/src/material/derive.ts`) is a pure,
deterministic function that fills EVERY legacy field: from the material by the laws below, from the
design by pass-through, or from a fixed policy. The result is an ordinary legacy `Params`: the existing
renderer, physics, firmware, `gen_params.py`, `dump:presets`, `e2e.sh` and screenshots all apply
unchanged, and the derived `Params` must pass the unchanged coherence rules
(`sim/src/material/coherence.ts`, the rules every signature preset passes today) for the class the
material implies. There is no firmware material struct: firmware receives the derived legacy preset.

Realism by design means: the user cannot reach an unrealistic corner because there is no knob for
it. One viscosity drives every viscosity-dependent field in the same direction; colour comes from
absorption, scattering and the chord length through the real bore; glow exists only when the
material emits; a non-wetting liquid leaves no film. Absolute SI dynamics are NOT the target: the
watch's motion is deliberately slowed (gravity `freeGain` = 570 px/s²) for readability, so the dynamic
laws map physical dimensionless groups onto the legacy regime through **anchored monotone maps**
calibrated to the existing class values. Coupling and ordering are the physics; the anchors are the
watch.

### Conventions

- Units: mm, mPa·s, kg/m³, mN/m, degrees, seconds; `g` = 9.81 m/s²; the panel's nominal pitch is
  0.083 mm/px (`MM_PER_PX`), used only where the legacy code uses it (`capShape`).
- **One physical→display conversion**: the drawn tube (`tubeHeight`, design) shows the whole vessel,
  so `pxPerMm = R_px / (r + wallThickness)` with `R_px = (tubeHeight − 1)/2`. Every length or speed
  that crosses between the material and the screen uses it: wall band, bubble diameter, bubble rise,
  and the physical speed behind the legacy reference edge speed `U₀ = 25 px/s` (`FILM_FULL_PX_S`):
  `U₀_mm = 25 / pxPerMm` mm/s (2.59 mm/s at the default 54 px tube: `pxPerMm` = 26.5/2.75 = 9.64).
- Reference bore `r₀` = 2.25 mm (the default), used only in the viscosity-class coordinate.
- Optical targets are computed in linear light and encoded **once**. Two encodings are named
  explicitly: `enc01(v)` = sRGB transfer, 0..1, and `enc255(v) = 255·enc01(v)`, 8-bit levels. The legacy
  palette (`buildPalette`, render.ts:83–193) mixes and scales *encoded* 8-bit RGB, so every palette
  pre-image below is written in `enc255` units; luma-based weights use `enc01`. Residuals are stated in
  8-bit levels (≤ 5 levels = 5/255). The panel dimmer `brightness` and the per-layer trims stay design.
- `anchored(x, [(x₀,y₀), (x₁,y₁), …])`: monotone piecewise-linear interpolation, clamped at both
  ends. Anchor tables list the coordinate first.
- `classClamp(value, range)`: after a law, the value is clamped into the coherence range of the
  inferred class. Where consecutive class ranges do not touch (e.g. `freeDamp` watery ≤ 1.5, medium
  ≥ 1.5, viscous ≥ 6) the law has a documented **jump at the class threshold**; there is no
  interpolation through forbidden values.

### Dimensionless coordinates (SI inside)

| Symbol | Definition | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `μ_eff` | `μ · (1000/ρ) · (r₀/r)²` — kinematic viscosity relative to water in the reference bore, in mPa·s-equivalents | viscosity class, every drag/damping law (`x_μ = log10 μ_eff`) |
| `Oh` | `μ / √(ρ γ r)` (Ohnesorge) | end bounce, wobble inertia |
| `Ca₀` | `μ U₀ / γ` (capillary number at the reference speed) | dynamic contact angle, film |
| `lc` | `√(γ / (ρ g))` mm (capillary length) | meniscus head/sag (`capLength`) |
| `v_b` | `2 ρ g r_b² / (9 μ)` (Stokes rise of a bubble of radius `r_b`, Δρ ≈ ρ), converted to px/s | bubble speed |
| `T` | luma-weighted two-flux transmittance of the centre chord (below) | opacity class, `liquidTransparency` |
| `E_lum` | luma of the emission RGB | emissive class, glow |

### Class inference (drives the coherence rules and the class clamps)

- viscosity: `phase = plasma → plasma`; else `metallic → metal`; else by `μ_eff`: `< 2.5 watery`,
  `2.5 ≤ μ_eff < 500 medium`, `≥ 500 viscous`. The anchor coordinates of every `x_μ` law sit exactly
  at the thresholds, `x₁ = log10 2.5 = 0.39794` and `x₂ = log10 500 = 2.69897` (written 0.398 / 2.699
  below), so a class-shared boundary value is reached exactly where the class changes. (Water 1, champagne 1.5, blood 3.8, milk 2.9,
  malt 3, olive oil 92, honey 7000; liquid oxygen 0.17, mercury 0.11 but metal.)
- opacity: `metallic → opaque`; else by `T`: `≤ 0.12 opaque`, `0.25–0.55 translucent`, `≥ 0.7 clear`.
  **Clear is for colourless liquids only** (PRESETS.md: a tinted liquid mixed toward the back turns
  khaki, so tinted ones are translucent): the class is clear only when the channel spread of the
  two-pass transmittance `max_i Tr_i² − min_i Tr_i² < 0.15`; otherwise `T = min(T, 0.55)`. `T` inside
  a gap (0.12–0.25, 0.55–0.7) is **snapped to the nearer band edge**, ties up — except that when the
  `T_max` bound (below) is the binding one the snap goes **down** so the composite stays attainable
  (a documented discontinuity inherited from the checker's disjoint bands; noted in KAIZEN).
- emissive: `E_lum > 0.02`. wetting: `contactAngle + contactHysteresis < 90` (concave);
  non-wetting: `contactAngle − contactHysteresis > 90`; a band that includes 90° is **rejected**.
- gas: `gasMode` directly (none / carbonated=dissolved / boiling / trapped).

### Exception precedence and rejections (visible errors, never a silent fix)

Precedence: **plasma** overrides everything (non-wetting, no gas, no slug, no film, no residue,
self-lit); then **metallic** (opaque conductor, metal dynamics class); then the dielectric laws.
Non-wetting is a surface property independent of the bulk class: a non-wetting non-plasma liquid
takes the checker's non-wetting spring band (350–800) whatever its viscosity, keeps its viscosity's
damping, and has no film or residue.

Rejected inputs: 1. a contact-angle band `θ ± h` that includes 90°. 2. `gasMode = dissolved` with a
non-watery class (carbonation implies watery). 3. plasma with `E_lum ≤ 0.02`, with `gasMode ≠ none`,
or with a design `freeLiquid = true` (plasma cannot slide; the design must say so, it is not silently
overwritten). 4. an emissive liquid with a backing brighter than luma 16 — the displayed backing, i.e. `tubeBack` and, when `tubeBackGradient ≠ 0`, `tubeBack2` too. 5. a clear
class with emission (the checker's clear `glassOverLiquid ≥ 0.5` and emissive `≤ 0.4` cannot both
hold; a glowing clear liquid is a translucent one with low absorption). 6. no illumination and no
emission (`E_l < 0.01` and `E_lum ≤ 0.02`: nothing to render). 7. any design key outside
`design.allow`, any non-finite or out-of-range property, a layout outside the panel (existing
`tubeLayout` limits). 8. sprite digits that do not fit the tube (`digitBottom + 8·digitScaleY >
tubeHeight`) — reported, not resized. 9. **overexposed**: the derived `liquid` reaches luma ≥ 248 levels (after the pre-image and emission), or the highlight floor cannot fit below 255 — lower `exposure`, `lightIntensity`, `ambient` or emission, or darken the backing. 10. **unrepresentable body**: the composite residual exceeds 5 levels after every bound and snap (a body brighter than the legacy mix can carry; lower `exposure` or the backing contrast). 12. **unattainable rim / wall shading (N levels)**: the solved side-light rim misses the wall sample by more than 5 levels (after the RGB565 round trip) even at the maximum `rimLight` gain 4 (see the `rimLight` row); or a channel sits ABOVE the wall target with the rim at 0 by more than one RGB565 step (8 levels) — the rim can only add light, and the luma-only `shadeDepth` fit magnified by quantisation is allowed one step (glow's blue), no more: an opaque class needs `shadeDepth ≥ 0.5`, so a flat-lit scattering body under a strong ambient (milk, ambient 1, exposure 0.5) is rejected rather than shown 25 levels off. 11. **design contradicts the material's realism rules**: `derive` runs `coherenceIssues` on the complete result for the inferred classes and rejects with those messages (a free slug switched off for a liquid, a sprite font that does not fit, on-top marks invisible against the backing, out-of-range trims…); design fields are never rewritten. Design values are validated against their `PARAM_META` bounds (and explicit non-negativity for the stiffness/rate fields) before derivation, and a current-version material/envelope with unknown keys is rejected — unknown keys are only dropped by an explicit older-version migration step. Rear marks behind an opaque liquid are allowed (the checker
allows them with `markContrast` 0; they show dimly through `T ≤ 0.12`).

## Colour model (two-flux Kubelka–Munk per channel, on the phase-1 cylinder trace)

Per channel `i` with absorption `K_i` (1/mm), reduced scattering `S` (1/mm), a chord length `d` (mm)
and a backing reflectance `Rg` behind the layer: `a = 1 + K/S`, `b = √(a² − 1)`, `x = b·S·d` (capped
at 50), `R(d, Rg) = (1 − Rg·(a − b·coth x)) / (a − Rg + b·coth x)`,
`Tr(d) = b / (a·sinh x + b·cosh x)`. **Limit branches** (executable, not limits taken by hand):
`S < 10⁻⁶`: Beer–Lambert `Tr = exp(−K d)`, `R = Rg·exp(−2 K d)`; `K < 10⁻⁹` with `S > 0`:
`Tr = 1/(1 + S d)`, `R = (Rg + S d (1 − Rg)) / (1 + S d (1 − Rg))`; `d ≤ 0`: `Tr = 1`, `R = Rg`.
(`S` is the *reduced* coefficient `μs(1−g)`: blood ≈ 1/mm with `K` ≈ (1, 20, 25) → `R∞` ≈ (0.27,
0.02, 0.02); milk `S` ≈ 3, `K` ≈ 0.001 → `R∞` ≈ 0.97.)

Chords come from `traceRow(y, wet, p)` (phase-1 `geometry.ts`, now `sim/src/material/optics/geometry.ts`): the centre
row (`d_c` ≈ 2r after refraction) and the wall sample at `u = 0.85` of the bore. **Display row of a
bore position**: the drawn tube spans the outer radius, so bore position `u` sits at row offset
`d(u) = u · r / (r + wallThickness)` from the centre (0.695 at the defaults, row fraction
`t = (1 + d)/2` = 0.848) — the same `d` feeds the backing gradient, the palette's chord factor
`(1 − √(1 − d²))²` in the `liquidThin` fit, and the `buildPalette` assertions. The panel row at
`y = 0.85 r` sees a ray refracted toward the axis, so its liquid chord is `d_w = 2r·√(1 − (0.85/ior)²)`
(1.54 r for water, 1.64 r for honey) — the traced chord, not the geometric one at that height; the
same ray supplies `F₃`/`F₄` below.
`traceRow` also gives the Fresnel transmission product `F_t` of the four interfaces. Illumination
(all × `exposure`): backing irradiance `E_b = backingLight(p)` (phase-1 `lighting.ts`, now `sim/src/material/optics/lighting.ts`: ambient +
projected light), liquid-side irradiance `E_l = ambient + 0.5·lightIntensity`.

Backing per sample: the palette blends each row against its own backing
`back(t) = mix(tubeBack, tubeBack2, m(t))`, `m` = `t` (gradient 1), `1 − |2t − 1|` (2), `|2t − 1|` (3),
0 (0), `t` = row fraction. The centre sample uses `t = 0.5`, the wall sample `t = (1 + d(0.85))/2` (0.848 at the defaults); the derived
`liquid` is fitted at the centre row, and rows with a different backing take the palette's own per-row
mix (more backing where the backing is brighter — the physically right direction, not a fitted one).
A gradient-backed fixture checks the centre-row residual.

Body radiance per channel at a sample of chord `d` and bore position `u`, from the light that
entered through the front wall along the **traced path**:
`C_i(u) = E_l·R_i(d, 0) + lin(back_i(t))·[R_i(d, 1) − R_i(d, 0)] + E_l·F_far(u)·Tr_i(d)² + C_side,i(u)`,
The backing term is the two-flux response to a white ground, `R(d, 1) − R(d, 0)`, scaled by the DISPLAYED backing colour `lin(back)`: the legacy compositor shows the dry backing at its hex brightness, so that colour is the ground truth for the wet side too (lighting the backing by `E_b·albedo` made a white backing derive darker under a colourless liquid than beside it, and a reflectance `Rg = lin(back)/E_l` capped at 1 still lost 30 % on white). `E_b` (`backingLight`) is not used by the colour model. The first term is the backing seen through the
liquid. The second is the light the far interfaces return: `F_far = 1 − (1 − F₃)(1 − F₄)` with `F₃`,
`F₄` the Fresnel reflectances at the traced ray's actual incidence on the far liquid→wall and
wall→air interfaces (`traceRow` exposes them; a face-on ray never reaches total internal reflection
there, so this term is 4–6 % at every row). **`C_side` is a separate, calibrated off-axis
approximation**, not part of the primary trace: environment light entering through the wall band from
outside the traced path lights the grazing rows through a thin chord,
`C_side,i(u) = exposure · (ambient + 0.25·lightIntensity) · u⁴ · Tr_i(d(u))` (the `u⁴` confines it to
the rims; the 0.25 share is calibrated so water gives the legacy `glassWallGlow` base 0.25). It is what
lights the rims of a tinted liquid on a dark ground. Emission `E_i` is NOT part of `C`; it is added
after the palette inversion (below).

| Legacy key | Law |
|---|---|
| `liquidTransparency` | Front-lit marks and backing are illuminated *through* the liquid and seen *through* it, so the legacy "how much shows through" is a **two-pass** quantity: `T_lum = luma(F_t · Tr_i(d_c)²)` (`F_t` covers the four interfaces once: two in, two out). The palette mixes the raw backing by one scalar, so it cannot show a colour-filtered backing; the largest transparency at which every channel of the composite stays attainable is `T_max = min_i t_i / back_i(0.5)`, `t_i = enc255(C_i(0) + E_i)` the `liquid` row's pre-image target (emission included), over channels with `back_i ≥ 8` levels (∞ on a dark backing). The pre-image also has an upper feasibility bound (no channel may need more than 255 levels): `T_up = min_i (255 − t_i) / (255 − back_i(0.5))` (so a bright emitter over a dark backing is held near opaque: the mix cannot show `C + E` through a transparency; glow 0.35 → 0.04) over channels with `back_i < 255`. `T = min(T_lum, T_max, T_up)`, then band-snapped as above (down when a bound binds). If the composite residual of the snapped result still exceeds 5 levels (opaque/translucent, non-plasma) the material is rejected (10) rather than shown wrong. A tinted liquid on a light backing therefore derives to a low transparency with the full colour in the body — the pattern the 2026-09-23 presets (pinot, cuvée) used by hand — and the composite residual stays ≤ 5 levels by construction. Metallic: 0. Plasma: 0.5 fixed. |
| `liquid` | Encoded-space pre-image of the palette's `mix(liquid, back, T)` (with `liquidBright` 1), 8-bit units: `liquid_i = clamp((enc255(C_i(0)) − T·back_i(0.5)) / (1 − T), 0, 255)` for the opaque and translucent classes (and metallic, `T` = 0), rounded to 8 bits and then **settled on the real palette**: the palette truncates the composite to RGB565, so a sub-level loss from rounding the pre-image can cross a 5-bit step (8 levels) the target does not (olive oil on #110b03: red 59.46 → 59 put the centre row at 33 against a target of 41); per channel, of the rounded value and its ±1 neighbours (±1 always outweighs a rounding loss of ≤ ½·(1 − T)), the one whose body-only centre row (`rimLight` 0, RGB565) is nearest `q565(enc255(C + E))` is taken, ties keeping the rounded value — before `rimTint` is fitted over it; the **clear class takes `enc255(C⁰_i(0))` directly**, where `C⁰` is the backing-independent body `E_l·[R_i(d, 0) + F_far·Tr_i²] + C_side` (the legacy mix adds the backing itself; dividing by `1 − T ≤ 0.3` is ill-conditioned and the mix cannot show a haze brighter than `(1−T)·255` anyway: that attenuation is an accepted, documented residual). The target includes the emission summed in linear light, `enc255(C_i + E_i)` (the legacy mix then shows `C + E` exactly; an emitter that clips is rejection 9); plasma is the exception: `liquid = enc255(E)` with no pre-image, the legacy xenon convention; emissive: the encoded value ÷ 1.3 (the `liquidBright` trim below, applied to `liquid`, `liquidLo` and `liquidHi` alike). The composite residual `\|((1−T)·liquid + T·back) − enc255(C + E)\|` (before the ÷ 1.3 trim) in 8-bit levels is reported per fixture and must be ≤ 5 levels for opaque/translucent fixtures. Metallic: `C = metalReflectance · E_l · 0.6` (grey conductor under diffuse light; the mirror term is the highlight). Plasma: `C = 0`. |
| `liquidLo` | Same rule (pre-image, or direct for clear) applied to the shaded body `enc255(C_i(0) · f_lo + E_i)`, `f_lo = max(0.15, ambient / max(10⁻⁶, ambient + lightIntensity))` (emission is not shaded); plasma `enc255(E_i)` directly (= `liquid`, no shading); emissive ÷ 1.3. |
| `liquidThin` | Fit of the palette's wall desaturation `mix(c, grey(max channel), liquidThin·(1−chord)²)` to the wall sample: `liquidThin = clamp((1 − sat(enc01 C(0.85)) / sat(enc01 C(0))) / (1 − √(1 − d(0.85)²))², 0, 1)`; 0 when `sat(enc01 C(0)) < 0.05`, when a colour is black (guarded normalisation), or metallic. |
| `shadeDepth` | Fitted to the wall sample: the palette darkens a row by `shadeDepth · (1 − λ(d))` under the world-up light, `λ(d) = cos(asin d)` (Lambert at the row's surface normal; 0.72 at `d` = 0.695), and physically only the *scattered* light is Lambert-shaded (a backlit transmission is not). The wall body without side light is `B_w = E_l · [λ(d)·R_i(d_w, 0) + (R_i(d_w, Rg) − R_i(d_w, 0)) + F_far·Tr²]`; `shadeDepth = clamp((1 − luma(B_w) / luma(B_c)) / (1 − λ(d)), class range)` (opaque 0.5–0.95, translucent 0.4–0.85, clear 0.3–0.55; class minimum when `luma(B_c)` = 0). A scattering opaque body → 0.95; a clear or backlit one → the class minimum. Metallic 0.95, plasma 0.85. |
| `liquidHi` | The specular is the light's colour added **over the body**, summed in linear light and encoded once: `enc255(clip(C_b + L_hi · (0.7·white + 0.3·thin) + 1.5·E))`, `C_b` = `C⁰(0)` for clear, else `C(0)`; `thin` = `C(0.85)` normalised to luma 1 (white when its luma < 10⁻⁴). Because the palette mixes `liquid` with the backing before adding the highlight, the checker compares the pre-image with the highlight; `liquidHi` is therefore **floored** at `luma(liquid) + 8` levels (scaled up uniformly), and a floor that would exceed 255 is rejection 9. Clear liquids get a neutral highlight (checker: saturation < 0.2). Metallic: white. Emissive ÷ 1.3. |
| `highlightH` | Rows of cylinder whose normal reflects the source into the viewer: `round(2 · R_px · sin(lightSize/4) · cos(lightElevation/2))`, ≥ 3 px, ≤ H/3 (30° source, 60° elevation, 54 px tube → 6 px). |
| `highlightSharp` | 2 (tent² ≈ the Gaussian source). `highlightInset` 0. |
| `highlightBright` | Specular radiance `L_hi = min(1, F(θ_i; 1 → wallIor) · lightIntensity · L_SPEC)`, `θ_i = lightElevation/2`, **`L_SPEC = 12`** (a lamp's radiance relative to a white diffuse surface, calibrated so `lightIntensity` 1 gives the legacy base band 0.35–0.55: F(30°) = 0.04 → 0.48). Mix weight that adds it over the body: `clamp(L_hi / max(0.05, 1 − luma(enc01 C(0))), 0, 1)` (normalised luma, 0..1). Metallic: `min(1.3, metalReflectance · lightIntensity · L_SPEC)` (metal is exempt from the ×liquidBright ≤ 1.3 rule). |
| `glassHi` | Neutral light colour `#dfe6ea`. `glassHiBright = 0.55·L_hi`, `glassReflect = 0.25·L_hi`, `glassRim = 0.45 + 0.35·L_hi` (grazing Fresnel → 1, clipped to the legacy look), `glassBody = 0.4·ambient`. |
| `glassWallGlow` | The legacy neutral wall band (light piped along the glass): `clamp(0.6 · exposure · (ambient + 0.25·lightIntensity) · luma(Tr_i(d_w)), 0, 1)` (water 0.27, oil 0.20, honey 0.15, ink 0). Metallic / plasma 0. |
| `rimLight`, `rimTint` (**new legacy Params, v24**, mirrored in `render.cpp` / `gen_params.py` / presets) | The side-lit rim of a tinted liquid on a dark ground: the palette adds `rimLight · u² · rimTint` (8-bit, clamped) to every liquid row after the transparency mix and before the highlight and glass, `u` = row offset from the centre (0..1); `rimLight` is a gain 0..4 (the sum clamps at 255, so a gain above 1 only extends the reach of the term at the sample row, whose `u²` shrinks with a thick wall: `u_w = 0.85·r/(r + wall)`). Zero in every legacy preset (byte-identical rendering, migration default). Derivation: for dielectric liquids with side light the gain is the smallest of 1, 2, 3, 4 at which no channel of the solved tint saturates (0 for metallic and plasma), and `rimTint` is **solved on the real palette**: `derive` builds the body-only `buildPalette` (the params with `rimLight` 0, the specular/glass overlays and `ambientLight` zeroed, `brightness` 1: the rows `check:materials` reads), reads the wall row `P_w` at `y = round(yc·(1 + d))`, and estimates `rimTint_i = clamp((target_w,i − P_w,i) / u_w², 0, 255)` per channel (`u_w` the palette's row coordinate there, ≈ `d`), `target_w` = `enc255(W_i + E_i)` after the RGB565 round trip, where `W = B_w + E_s·u⁴·Tr(d_w)` is the full wall sample with its scattered share Lambert-shaded (the `shadeDepth` row's `B_w` plus the side light; metallic `λ·C`). `P_w` is itself RGB565-quantised (5-bit blue: 8-level steps), so each channel is then settled on the rendered row: the integer tint whose RGB565 channel is nearest the target (the row is monotone in the tint; bisection). The fitted row is then measured on the real palette (both sides after the RGB565 round trip): a residual above 5 levels in a channel the rim answers for (a vessel whose wall leaves the rim term no reach, e.g. olive oil in a 0.5 mm bore with a 1 mm wall: 25 levels at gain 4) is **rejection 12, unattainable rim** — never a silent saturation; a channel already above the target with no rim (tint 0) is the body shading's miss, which an additive rim cannot lower: it is reported (`DeriveReport.rim.bodyOver`, printed by `check:materials`), not rejected (glow: blue one RGB565 step, 8 levels, over). The fit is exact at the sample (0 levels on every fixture, including olive oil with a 1 mm wall); at the silhouette the rim is `1/u_w²` ≈ 2× brighter, as the side light is. Water (#0a0e10) gain 2, (131,131,125) (at gain 1 it clips: (255,255,250)); olive oil with a 1 mm wall gain 2, (147,154,100); olive oil (194,196,111); honey (184,177,61); cola (197,185,140); pinot on parchment (122,71,82); blood (0,0,0), milk (10,10,10): ≈ 0 (no side light through an opaque body). |
| `glassOverLiquid` | Share of the empty wall's specular that survives over the liquid: an empty tube reflects at the outer and inner wall surfaces, a filled one at the outer and the (index-matched) wall–liquid interface: `ratio = (F(1→wallIor) + F(wallIor→ior)) / (2·F(1→wallIor))` at normal incidence (water 0.54, honey 0.50, mercury 1); relative to the body's own light: `ratio / (1 + 2·E_lum)`; then **clamped to the inferred class**: emissive `≤ 0.4`, clear `≥ 0.5` (rejection 5 removes the overlap). |
| `glassWall` | Projected wall band: `wallThickness · pxPerMm` (0.5 mm, 54 px tube → 4.8 px). |
| `lightPhys` / `lightAngle` | Non-emissive: 1 (world-up light from the IMU) / `lightElevation/2`. Emissive: 0 / `lightElevation/2` (self-lit; the checker's binary rule — KAIZEN: a weakly self-lit liquid would want a share). |
| `ambientLight` | 0. The legacy `ambientize` desaturates bright colours toward white as a stand-in for room reflections; the derived highlight, rim and thin-chord colours already contain the white light, so applying it again turned tinted rims grey (cola came out beige). |
| `liquidBright`, `brightness` | `liquidBright = 1`; emissive: 1.3 with the derived encoded `liquid`/`liquidHi`/`liquidLo` ÷ 1.3 (the palette scales encoded values, so the product is unchanged). `brightness` design. |
| `markContrast` | Legibility policy: opaque 0; otherwise 24 when any marks are behind the liquid, else 0. |
| `tickLens`, `bottomLens` | Depth warp of rear marks seen through the liquid cylinder grows with its index: `min(1, 0.45·(ior − 1)/0.333)` (water 0.45, oil 0.63). The dry-side and rod fields are design (rod calibration). |
| `bubbleRim` | `enc255(min(1, E_s·Tr(r) + 0.35·C⁰(0)))` with the backing-free body `C⁰`, `E_s = exposure·(ambient + 0.25·lightIntensity)` (the side-light irradiance of the rim term) and `Tr(r)` the Kubelka–Munk transmission over half the bore (the side light is filtered by the liquid on its way to the bubble: a tinted liquid's bubbles carry its colour, a colourless one's stay white). A bubble's rim totally reflects the light inside the liquid, not the backing behind it: it reads darker than a light backing and brighter than a dark one (the former `0.65·white` made bubbles vanish on white). The renderer shades the ring by the liquid's body lighting at that row (not the composited row: backing, surface highlight and glass do not light a bubble), so on a dark backing a bubble is lighter than the liquid. Frizzante: luma 219 on #ffffff, 181 on #000000. `bubbleDark = 1 − (1 − F)²`, `F = ((n − 1)/(n + 1))²`: the core is a clear window that loses only the reflection at its two surfaces (water 0.04, oil 0.07; the former `0.25 + 0.5·(1 − T)` drew dark cores). |

## Edge and glow

| Key | Law |
|---|---|
| `edgeGlow`, `glowStrength` | Non-emissive: a caustic of the backing light focused by the meniscus, `glowStrength = min(0.25, 0.08 · lightIntensity · T)` (ink 0, water 0.07), `edgeGlow = 19` px. Emissive: `glowStrength = anchored(E_lum, [(0.02, 0.4), (1, 0.8)])`, `edgeGlow = 18 + 16·min(1, E_lum)` px. Metallic non-emissive: 0/0. |
| `frontBright` | Bright convex cap: metallic 20, emissive `round(16 · min(1, E_lum) + 4)`, else 0. |
| `edgeLightGain` | 0.55 (tilt changes the light at the cap; fixed policy). Emissive 0.3. |
| `edgeSoft` | 2.4 px (the contact line seen through the rod); non-wetting 0 (a sharp bead). |
| `surfaceBand` 0.35, `surfaceRim` 0.45, `surfaceWidth` 4, `surfaceTone` 0 | Fixed to the current meniscus look (2026-09-23 presets). |
| `surfaceFill` | `clamp(1 − 0.9·T)` (a clear liquid's dish is see-through, an opaque one is filled). `surfaceBlick = 0.9·highlightBright`. |
| `cornerR` | design. `meniscusLens` design (rod). |

## Meniscus and dynamics (all through `μ_eff`, `Oh`, `Ca₀`, `lc`)

Class anchors are the legacy class partials (watery / medium / viscous / metal in `params.ts`) and
the coherence ranges. `x_μ = log10 μ_eff`; class thresholds at `x_μ = 0.398` (2.5) and `2.699` (500).

| Key | Law |
|---|---|
| `contactAngle`, `contactHyst` | Pass-through of the material pair. Plasma: 100 / 0 fixed. |
| `contactDyn` | Cox–Voinov at the reference speed: `θ_d³ = 9·Ca₀·ln(L/l)` with `ln(L/l) = 9.2` (10⁴ scale ratio), `contactDyn = min(90, deg(∛(9·Ca₀·9.2)))`. `Ca₀ = μ·U₀_mm/γ` with `U₀_mm = 25/pxPerMm`. Water 8.2°, blood 14.1°, olive oil 47°, honey 90° (clamped), mercury 5.1° — the legacy 8 / 15 / 40 / 90 / 3. Plasma 0. |
| `capLength` | `lc · (R_disp / r)` with `R_disp = ((tubeHeight − 1)/2)·0.083` mm: `capShape` uses the drawn radius for the Bond number, so the ratio `(R/lc)²` is preserved under display scaling. Water 2.65, oil 1.85, mercury 1.87, honey 2.19 (54 px tube). |
| `freeGain` | 570 (watch gravity, every liquid). `freeHomeK`, `readTilt*`, `playHold`, `freeLiquid` design; plasma forces `freeLiquid = false`. |
| `freeDamp` | `anchored(x_μ, [(−1, 0.5), (0, 0.8), (0.398, 1.4) ∣ (0.398, 1.6), (1, 2.5), (2.699, 4) ∣ (2.699, 6), (4, 9), (5, 14)])` (∣ = class jump), then class clamp (metal 0.8–1.5). Water 0.8, blood 1.87, milk 1.67, oil 3.35, honey 8.65, mercury 0.52 → 0.8 (clamped). |
| `freeBounce` | `anchored(log10 Oh, [(−3.5, 0.55), (−2.6, 0.2), (−2.0, 0.1), (−1.0, 0.03), (−0.5, 0)])`, class clamp. Mercury 0.51, water 0.20, blood 0.10, oil 0 → 0.05 (clamped), honey 0. |
| `meniscusK` | `base(x_μ) · √(γ/72 · 1000/ρ)` (square root of the capillary frequency ratio `γ/(ρ r³)` at fixed r), `base = anchored(x_μ, [(0, 475), (0.398, 420) ∣ (0.398, 340), (2.699, 210) ∣ (2.699, 140), (4, 90), (5, 60)])`; metal and every non-wetting liquid: base 650, clamped to 350–800 (metal 500–800); plasma 400 fixed; class clamp. Water 475, honey 79, mercury 500 (clamped up). |
| `meniscusDamp` | `anchored(x_μ, [(−1, 4), (0, 8), (0.398, 14), (2.699, 24) ∣ (2.699, 26), (4, 34), (5, 50)])`, class clamp (metal 8–16: mercury 4.2 → 8). Plasma 30. |
| `meniscusInertia` | `anchored(x_μ, [(0, 3), (2.699, 2), (5, 1)])`; metal 4; plasma 0. |
| `angleTiltGain` | `anchored(x_μ, [(0, 6.5), (0.398, 5), (2.699, 3) ∣ (2.699, 2.5), (4, 1.5), (5, 0.5)])`; metal 2; plasma 0.5. `angleMax` 6 (plasma 2). |
| `angleGyroGain` | `anchored(x_μ, [(0, 0.42), (0.398, 0.30), (2.699, 0.15) ∣ (2.699, 0.12), (4, 0.06), (5, 0.02)])` (0.30 is valid in both the watery and the medium band, so the class change is continuous); metal 0.4; plasma 0.03. |
| `fillK` 756, `fillDamp` 40, `fillSloshGain` 5.5, `angleK` 207, `angleDamp` 17.6 | Fixed (the pinned-column caps in `physics.ts` bound them anyway). Plasma: 260 / 22 / 0.5 / 300 / 26. |
| `acrossK` 200, `acrossDamp` 20, `acrossGyroGain` 0, `shakeGain` 0, `deadzone` 0, `accelLpHz` 15.2, `gyroHpHz` 5, `gyroDeadzone` 31, `gyroMax` 470, `inputGain` 1 | Fixed IMU policy (the 2026-09-23 presets' values). |

## Film and residue (wetting liquids only; non-wetting and plasma: `wetFilm` 0, `traces` off)

| Key | Law |
|---|---|
| `wetFilm` | Landau–Levich: the deposited film grows as `Ca^(2/3)`; the legacy value is the drawn trail length, so `wetFilm = anchored(log10 Ca₀, [(−5, 8), (−4.5, 10), (−3.9, 15), (−2.3, 18), (−1, 26), (0, 30)])`, class clamp. Water 10.5, blood 15.3, oil 18.8, honey 28.3. |
| `traces` | `solidsFraction > 0`. |
| `traceAmount` | `0.3 + 1.7 · solidsFraction · (1 − T)` (a stain of a dark liquid reads denser). Blood 1.0, ink 1.15, oil 0.6. |
| `traceStain` | `0.05 + 0.65 · solidsFraction`. `traceDry = clamp(dryingTime, 0.1, 2)` (the checker's watch regime; the schema allows up to 10 s and the excess is clamped, documented). |
| `traceFollow` | Drain-back ∝ 1/μ: `anchored(x_μ, [(0, 0.5), (0.398, 0.3), (2.699, 0.15), (4, 0.06), (5, 0.03)])` (continuous; 0.15 satisfies the viscous ≤ 0.15 bound). |
| `traceThin` | `anchored(x_μ, [(0, 1.5), (2.699, 0.6), (4, 0.3)])`. `traceFilm = 0.05 · solidsFraction · clamp(x_μ / 2.699)` (a permanent coat needs a viscous, solids-rich liquid). |

## Gas

| Key | Law |
|---|---|
| `fizz` | `gasMode ≠ none` and not plasma. |
| `fizzSize` | Drawn diameter `2·r_b · pxPerMm` px (0.06 mm, 54 px tube → 1.16 px), bounded only by the drawable range 1–16 px (no class clamp: the size is the look's, so the bubble-radius slider is live over its whole 0.02–0.4 mm; 0.4 mm, 54 px tube → 7.7 px). The spread `fizzSizeVar` is a design key. |
| `fizzSpeed` | `anchored(log10 v_b[px/s], [(−1, 0), (0.5, 3), (1.5, 20), (2, 40), (2.5, 55), (3, 60)])`, class clamp (carbonated 30–55, boiling 45–60, trapped 0–8). `v_b` in px/s = `v_b[m/s] · 1000 · pxPerMm`. Water/0.06 mm: 76 px/s → 35; cola/0.07 mm: 89 → 38; honey/0.12 mm: 0.04 px/s → 0 (trapped band); liquid oxygen (μ 0.19, ρ 1141)/0.05 mm: 315 px/s → 55. |
| `fizzCount` | carbonated `30 + 30·gasLevel`, boiling `45 + 15·gasLevel`, trapped `round(120·gasLevel)` (a few held bubbles to a dense suspension; honey 0.04 → 5). `fizzFoamLife = foamStability`. |
| `fizzFlatRise`, `fizzEdgeRise`, `fizzDriftGain` | Scale with the rise: `s = min(1, fizzSpeed/30)`: `0.15 + 0.3 s`, `0.2 + 0.3 s`, `0.4 + 0.6 s`. `fizzAcrossGain fizzSquash fizzShadeOff fizzDepth fizzBlick` are design keys. |
| `bubble*` (spirit level) | `bubble` off; the rest at `DEFAULT_PARAMS`. |

  `derive` asserts that the union of the three sets is exactly `keyof Params`, so a new legacy field
  cannot appear without an owner.

## Fixtures (computed with the reference prototype of these laws)

Inputs common to all: bore 2.25 mm, wall 0.5 mm, wall index 1.49, light 60° / 30° / 1.0, ambient 0.2,
exposure 1, 54 px tube (`pxPerMm` 9.64), design backing as listed. Colours are 8-bit encoded levels; tolerance ±3 levels on colours and ±0.03 on the glass/highlight weights (the prototype approximated the far-interface incidence angles that `traceRow` computes exactly), ±2 % on dynamics, exact on classes, booleans and clamped values.

Boundary fixtures (finite output, no exception): K = S = 0; K = 0 with S = 3; S = 0 with K = 50; a
zero-length chord (`u` = 1); ambient 0 with light 0 and emission 0.3 (allowed: self-lit; at 0.5 the body, now summed with its emission in linear light, pre-images to display white and is rejection 9); black
backing with a colourless liquid (zero-colour normalisation); `E_lum` at 0.02 and 0.021 (both sides
of the emissive threshold, `glassOverLiquid` respects the class clamp on both); a
yellow liquid (K (0.002, 0.03, 2.6)) with T_lum ≥ 0.7 classes as translucent, not clear; oil on white at
exposure 2.5 (T_max 0.20 in the gap) snaps down to 0.12 with residual ≤ 5 levels; T at 0.12, 0.185,
0.25, 0.55, 0.625, 0.7 (snap direction); the encoded composite `(1−T)·liquid + T·back` versus
`enc255(C)` for a black backing, T 0.5 and target linear 0.2 (expects 248 → composite 124 levels);
a gradient backing (`tubeBackGradient` 2, dark `tubeBack`, light `tubeBack2`) and a light uniform
backing (parchment) behind a translucent liquid, both with the centre-row residual ≤ 5 levels (via
`T_max`); a bright scattering body (`S` 0.05, `K` (0, 0.3, 0.3), exposure 4, black backing) either
snaps down through `T_up` to a residual ≤ 5 or is rejected (10); design bounds: `freeHomeK` −1 rejected,
`digitBright` 10 rejected (11), `freeLiquid` false for a liquid rejected (11), sprite `digitScaleY >
digitScaleX` rejected (11); actual `buildPalette(params)` centre AND wall rows (`y = round(yc·(1 + d))`) reproduce the
targets within 5 levels after the RGB565 round trip for every non-clear, non-plasma fixture (the wall
row through the fitted `shadeDepth` and the solved `rimTint`); a fixture with `rimLight` 0 renders
byte-identically to the same params before v24 (`check:meniscus` parity unchanged); overexposure: milk at exposure 3 rejected (9), milk at exposure 1.1 accepted with `luma(liquidHi) > luma(liquid)`; `μ_eff` exactly at 2.5 and 500 and one step either side (class, `traceFollow`
≤ 0.15 with traces on at 500, `freeDamp` jump direction).

Every fixture's derived `Params` must return zero coherence issues for its inferred class, and the
viscosity sweep μ = 0.2 … 10⁵ (other inputs fixed) must give monotone non-increasing `freeBounce`,
`meniscusK`, `angleTiltGain`, `angleGyroGain`, `traceFollow`, `traceThin`, `fizzSpeed` and monotone
non-decreasing `freeDamp`, `meniscusDamp`, `contactDyn`, `wetFilm`, `traceFilm` **across the whole
sweep** (the class-threshold jumps go in the same direction as the law; the boundary values shared by
two classes make `angleGyroGain`, `angleTiltGain` and `traceFollow` continuous).

## Provenance of preset values

Every physical preset (`sim/src/material/presets.ts`, `presets/materials/*.json`) records for each
property `measured` (a handbook value at 20 °C), `estimated` (a plausible value, e.g. absorption
coefficients chosen for the look) or `artistic` (emission, lighting, exposure). Optical absorption
coefficients are estimates unless stated; viscosities, densities, surface tensions and refractive
indices of the common liquids are handbook values.
